Different dialogue options serve different functions and have different consequences. In some cases there is no consequence whatsoever behind a specific reply. Some dialogue options serve only as a means to further story telling; questions that one asks, information to gain. Other options equal decisions, some with mild consequences, e.g. influencing the mood of the NPC talked to, other with heavy consequences, like the decision for a guild. One crucial and new kind of "heavy" consequence are attitude-forming decisions; they are what we are dealing with here.

In the official successor they included a question by letting a peasant ask the hero: "Are you for the peasants or for the king?" This would be an ideal example of an attitude-forming decision, but there was no consequence involved. 

The peasant asking the question forces the player to answer in favour of one of the two and does not allow him to express any other position. 

Inspite of demanding such a binary answer from the player, when asked back who *he* is for, he doesn't give a clear answer himself. An even bigger disappointment is that whatever the player replies does not matter. The peasant demands a precise answer, while the player was not even confronted yet with the two factions and has good reason not to reply in a binary way; he simple may not yet be for any of the two. When he replies in the binary way the peasant wants, for either this or that faction, the NPC reacts negatively to both answers. This deprives the dialogue almost of any meaning. In the end, nothing was really said, the player only made a guess which answer the NPC may want to hear and then he found both answers equally bad. 

It was a surprising outcome and served as a neat ambient dialogue and there is nothing wrong with that - we will have many dialogues without consequences too -, but it is a missed opportunity. And this applies to the entire game...

In fact there are no attitude forming decisions at all that would have any consequences on how the hero evolves and expresses himself in future dialogues.

The same kind of question also could have been asked later in the story when the player actually has been confronted with these factions and has an idea about their positions, what they do, what they want. Here it could have been asked in a way that it has meaning and consequence. The player then would not just choose an answer of which he hopes that it pleases the other; he would actually express his opinion and thereby make a decision which would then develop his character into a specific direction; which could then open up new dialogues and block others. Something like that did not exist. 


## Formable Attitudes

In order to change that, we have at first to decide and to formulate specific positions or attitudes that we want the player to be able to choose. 

As a few exemplary cases: within the first chapter, there are character forming decisions such as...

* **Relation to ones conviction:** Does the player consider his character as innocent or does he choose a crime as his true background story? Does he claim to be innocent or tell lies about his crime(s), e.g. to impress? 
* **Relation to the prison and the Outside World:** What does the player think about the prison? Is he hating on the king and the realm or not? Does he identify himself with the other prisoners or remain distant and aloof? Which consequences does he draw from these positions in regard to his striving for freedom? 
* **Relation to freedom:** How does he want to achieve freedom? Will he want to gain the individual freedom of power? Only then will he prefer and be considered fitting for the Mafia. Or does he feel inclined to a different way of individual power, not that of the sword, but that of magic? Does he consider this kind of freedom as oppression and prefer to join those without a master, who strive for collective freedom? Does he consider both approaches as futile and see spiritual freedom as the most important and thus join the sect? And does he join any of these factions for opportunistic reasons, without believing in their cause or does he actually share their positions?

It is not just about "Which faction does he serve?" or "Which faction does he make missions for?" and "How does he decide within such missions?". All of this will remain important, but there are attitudes and preferences underlying these decisions. And these attitudes and preferences have to be expressed first. The player can of course try to play as neutral as possible, but specific NPCs will demand specific replies and decisions from the player that will not remain without a consequence. 

Then there follow decisions like these:
* Is he actually believing in these ways and struggles he joined or is he following his chosen path for mere opportunistic and pragmatical reasons? The latter of which automatically excludes specific paths, because there are some things in this world which cannot be achieved without actual conviction.
* When belonging to the Shadows: Does he believe in their cause and their role as snitchers and spies of the barons or does he just feel inclined to this path for pragmatical reasons while actually being critical of them? Only if the player expresses a specific attitude through several hints in dialogues and other decisions, later an option may open up to e.g. become a double agent for the Organisation or rather: His formerly shaped personality will decide which kinds of options he will have in the case of receiving such an offer. If he hinted in dialogues at his loyalty to the barons and critizised the NC (and meaning it), some options will be excluded and others will open up, which would not have been there when a different attitude would have been formed.
* The Gurus, at least some of them, can read ones mind. They know if someone lies. If the player character does not believe in the teachings of the Gurus, it is of course impossible to become one of them. Everything else would be unbelievable.
* Among the Mages, it will be crucial to develop ones character in regard to his relation to the gods (does he lean to a clerical/religious or to a rather anti-clerical practice, does he believe in the gods, does he prefer a god?), his relation to the circles, which is connected with his preferences for a camp, his relation to different magical schools, which will influence e.g. who will be ready to teach him, which kinds of spells he can learn etc.

All possible decisions to be made have to feel consistent with the character forming decisions that were made before, in order to be believable roleplay. 

It is only in this way, that in course of these attitude formative decisions one player in the end can actually play a cunning thief who is a loyal servant of the Barons while another one on the same Shadow path may be an opportunistic thief only serving his own interests, working as a double agent for the Organisation, ready to betray his masters in the next best moment. One may be a firm believer in the ideals of the Scraper's Union and act accordingly, while someone else just joined them as he thought it would be the easiest path with the least exploitation. One may be a cruel Battlemage in aspiration of more destructive power, and someone else may focus on grey magic more or even on healing and helping others. One may be a mercenary without much hope in the escape plan simply because he finds the other factions insane and has sympathy with Lee, while another believes in the plan and admires the Watermages but does not really agree with Lees hatred against the Outside World. Same guild paths, but different attitudes. 

But there is another aspect we have to consider... 


## Intention of Replies

In order to do that it must be clear to the player whether the answer he is about to give is the true position of his character or if it is a lie, e.g. a mere opportunistic reply due to an attempt to fulfill the expectations of others. The intention of the reply must be clear to the player in order to take an informed decision when choosing a dialogue option.

It would be wrong to let the player reply in a way that he only chooses because he hopes that the other wants to hear it (while himself thinking differently) and then we count this reply as a decision which opens up new dialogues and shape the character into a direction that only makes sense when what he said before was true and in accordance with what the player actually thinks or wants his character to think. 

If we do not differentiate these options and do not take this into account, we would confuse the player and it would result in a character development that goes into a different direction than what the player actually wanted to go in. 

Therefore we have to add the additional complexity to dialogues, that we have to tell the player, alongside some specific answers, if they are meant to be true and consistent with his actual opinion or if something is only said to please, while his position is different. In one example, the situation may look like this:

* "I am for the king (true statement <> provocative lie)"
* "I am for the rebels (true statement <> opportunistic lie)"

Sometimes the player would have different options to express such different modes. In other cases, like here, the very same answers may be possible to give in two different modes, that the player can select (with arrows left/right).

The reply "I am for the king [true intention]" will result in a different character development and open up different future options than the reply "I am for the king [provocative lie]". The sentence is exactly the same, the intention is different. 

Since the NPC doesn't hear any difference in the reply (unless he can read his mind and knows if he means what he says or not - another reason why this differentiation is important), it may not result in a different reply of said NPC, but it tells us: "The player does not like the king, but he is opportunistic and/or fearsome enough to say so if he thinks that someone wants to hear that." This will influence the attitude formation.

Obviously, some players may choose a different reply than what they themselves are inclined to. They may say that they are for the king and that this is a true statement, while they themselves do not prefer this answer, in order to get an expected, positive result. In such a case they simply have to be aware that such a true statement of course has consequences and counts as an identity forming decision of their character which will influence the story and the available options in the future. 

So when they utter "true" statements while actually wanting to lie, they will sooner or later realise that it would have been better to choose the lie, as now their character has shaped in a direction where the available options are less and less in accordance with what the player himself may want to express and would have been able to express when he would have choosen the options he is actually inclined to. 

This system can cause some frustration, if one doesn't play honestly and not according to the role he actually wants to play. Abusing the system is possible, but that only means abusing ones own playthrough and corrupting ones character development. The potential of abuse due to dishonest players who seek to get a specific outcome in opposition to what they feel would fit their character, does not outweigh the positive possibilities of more individual expression and influence of ones role.
