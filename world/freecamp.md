# Free Camp

*Flosha, 07.09.2025*

An anarchistic camp without leaders, describing itself as the "most free camp in the colony". 


## Guilds of the Free Camp

The Free Camp is a special case in that all of its members belong to the so called *Scraper's Union*. The Union consists primarily of *Scrapers*, but also of *Rangers* and *Bodyguards*.
* *Scrapers* also call themselves *Free Diggers*, in opposition to the Diggers of the Old Camp, which they describe as "Slave Diggers". Scrapers are the leaders of the camp (again opposed to the Old Camp, where the diggers are the lowest of all groups).  
* *Rangers*, also described as *Free Thieves*, "provide" material for the Camp; they teach the diggers to set traps, to defend themselves from the monsters in the mine; they also work as hunters at the surface to provide the camp with food (see [here a concept for them by Mike](https://images.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/mikehoge/npcs/signal-2021-02-14-120600_Fallensteller-Src.jpeg).
* *Bodyguards* are just independent guards working for the Free Camp, they protect the diggers primarily against the Mafia and their thugs when the Scrapers make deals at the exchange place. They also explore new cave systems in order to make sure that they're safe. 

* An early idea was that they have an escaple plan on their own: "They try to dig themselves through under the barrier, but stumble upon the hindrance of the Temple and elsewhere upon mine crawlers, a hindrance too." This idea was already discarded in Guilds V2
