# Scrapers Union

*Flosha, 07.09.2025*

[ToDo: Add renderings of light, medium, heavy scraper OR just a heavy one in a mining scene with ore, union flag, blueish light etc.]

The *Scrapers* are organised in the so called "Scrapers Union". They also call themselves *Free Diggers* ("Freie Buddler" in Guilds V1), in opposition to the Diggers of the Old Camp, which they describe as "Slave Diggers". It is also a scraper who (inofficially, with non-coercive natural authority in a camp that officially is without a leader) leads the camp (again opposed to the Old Camp, where the diggers are the lowest of all groups).  
> "Medium-sized group, have split from the Old Diggers in order to not lose half of the earnings to the Mafia" (Guilds V1)

## Relationships 

**Guilds V1:**  
* They are in a friendly relationship with the other guilds of the Free Camp (their *Free Thieves* and *Bodyguards*). They are in a friendly relationship with the healing/water mages and the New Camp's mercenaries (but the Mercenaries themselves have a neutral relationship to them). They also have a friendly relationship with the whole Sect, due to their ongoing cooperation with the Union (Templars protect the diggers from crawlers and get their crawler secretion on the other hand, escort them to the exchange place and get drug ingrediences in return). 
* They are in a bad relationship with the *Ore Thieves* (the "Organisation" of the New Camp, because they sometimes steal ore from the Free Camp too); they are in a bad relationship with the Mafia (Barons), the Mafia's Thugs (Guards) and the Mafia's spies (Shadows).
* They are neutral to everyone else (such as the Demon Summoner, the firemages, the peasants, the Old Camp's diggers and so on.

V2 does not tell us directly if the relationship of guilds is good, bad or neutral, but it contains opinions in the form of what other guilds say about the Scrapers and what the Scrapers say about them, from which we will be able to deduce if their relationship was meant to be good, bad or neutral at the time. 

In the game they differentiated this system further, in (1) friendly, (2) neutral, (3) angry and (4) hostile.
