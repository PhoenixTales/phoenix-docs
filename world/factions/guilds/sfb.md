The *Scrapers* are organised in the so called "Scrapers Union" ("Schürferbund"). They also call themselves *Free Diggers* ("Freie Buddler" in Guilds V1), in opposition to the Diggers of the Old Camp, which they describe as "Slave Diggers". It is also a scraper who (inofficially, with non-coercive natural authority in a camp that officially is without a leader) leads the camp (again opposed to the Old Camp, where the diggers are the lowest of all groups).  
> "Medium-sized group, have split from the Old Diggers in order to not lose half of the earnings to the Mafia" (Guilds V1)

## NPCs

**Author:** Mike Hoge 

**"The Scrapers Union"** 
*20 People:*  

* 1x **The Mine Inspector** ["Mineninspektor"]: former warden, who had always stood up for the prisoners; he stayed here voluntarily and has earned great respect; primary target of the shadows & orebarons (level 6); bosom friend of "Chief", who warns him of assassinations; hires the player as bodyguard or as "rescuer" of Sniffer. 
* 1x **The Ore Sniffer**: Second Man in the Scrapers Union; seems to literally smell ore veins; disappears again and again for a few days in the mines and then specifies [a] new drilling direction; knows ALL the secret passages & hiding places of the mines and orc caves (level 5)
* 1x **The Builder** ["Baumeister"]: secures new & old tunnels with support structures; repairs tools & weapons in the Free Camp; friend of "Cave-Scare" ["Höhlenschreck; a ranger] -> Cooperation (level 5)
* 2x **Sorters** ["Sortierer"]: experienced scrapers who sort the precious ore lumps from the chopped rock (level 4)
* 10x **Scrapers** ["Schürfer"]: Workhorses; Chopping & Shoveling (level 3)
* 5x **Carriers** ["Träger"]: Carry ore from A to B; Errand boys and girls for everything (1)

The idea of the leader of the Scrapers being a former warden has at least partially been preserved, in that in the release version the leader seems to be "Okyl"; while Okyl according to the Screenshot Story was a former guard in the Old Camp; but here he was a guard under the baron's rule, after the creation of the barrier, and he stayed there for a long time (almost until the conviction of the player). Only later joining the New Camp as an organiser, liberating Gjan, together with Lares, from the bandits (Quentin's guys), and later apparently taking responsibility in the Free Camp. The original idea was different, here it was about a warden at the time before the creation of the barrier who decided to stay in the prison inspite of *knowing* about the plan to create the barrier.

## Relationships 

**Guilds V1** (by Mike Hoge):  
* They are in a friendly relationship with the other guilds of the Free Camp (their *Free Thieves* and *Bodyguards*). They are in a friendly relationship with the healing/water mages and the New Camp's mercenaries (but the Mercenaries themselves have a neutral relationship to them). They also have a friendly relationship with the whole Sect, due to their ongoing cooperation with the Union (Templars protect the diggers from crawlers and get their crawler secretion on the other hand, escort them to the exchange place and get drug ingrediences in return). 
* They are in a bad relationship with the *Ore Thieves* (the "Organisation" of the New Camp, because they sometimes steal ore from the Free Camp too); they are in a bad relationship with the Mafia (Barons), the Mafia's Thugs (Guards) and the Mafia's spies (Shadows).
* They are neutral to everyone else (such as the Demon Summoner, the firemages, the peasants, the Old Camp's diggers and so on.

V2 does not tell us directly if the relationship of guilds is good, bad or neutral, but it contains opinions in the form of what other guilds say about the Scrapers and what the Scrapers say about them, from which we will be able to deduce if their relationship was meant to be good, bad or neutral at the time. 

In the game they differentiated this system further, in (1) friendly, (2) neutral, (3) angry and (4) hostile.
