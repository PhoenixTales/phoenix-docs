Guilds V1:
* Described as *Free Diggers* ("Freie Buddler", in Guilds V1)
* "medium-sized group, have split from the Old Diggers in order to not lose half of the earnings to the Mafia" (Guilds V1)
* An early ideas was that they have an escaple plan on their own: "They try to dig themselves through under the barrier, but stumble upon the hindrance of the Temple and elsewhere upon mine crawlers, a hindrance too." This idea was already discarded in Guilds V2

*  
* They have their own thieves guild, called *Free Thieves* (Guilds V1), later *Rangers* ("Fallensteller" (FLL), literally Trappers, in Guilds V2)
* They also have their own bodyguards, called 
* According to Guild System V1 the Free Camp hosts the headquarter of the Secret Thieves Guild (Mst), that the four friends etc. belong to

Relationships:  
* Guilds V1: They are in a friendly relationship with the other guilds of the Free Camp (their *Free Thieves* and *Bodyguards*). They are in a friendly relationship with the healing/water mages and the New Camp's mercenaries (but the Mercenaries themselves have a neutral relationship to them), but in a bad relationship with the *Ore Thieves* (the "Organisation" of the New Camp, because they sometimes steal ore from the Free Camp too); they also have a friendly relationship with the whole Sect, due to their ongoing cooperation with the Union (Templars protect the diggers from crawlers and get their crawler secretion on the other hand). They are in a bad relationship with the Mafia (Barons), the Mafia's Thugs (Guards) and the Mafia's spies (Shadows) and neutral to everyone else (such as the Demon Summoner, the firemages, the peasants, the Old Camp's diggers and so on.
