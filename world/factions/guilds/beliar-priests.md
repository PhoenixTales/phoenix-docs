# Beliar Priests

* **No face, no name:** Upon initiation they put on a blindfold or mask to hide their face, to restrict their senses and reject their former identity; the name they had before is buried and forgotten, but not to be replaced with a different name, as is common among clerics; they simply have none. The priests may refer to each other as brothers or sisters while others refer to them as "priest", "master" or the like.  
 
* **Group :** Called Priests of Beliar, Beliar priests, priests of Vandras (older name of Beliar), alternatively "Beliari" or "Vandrani". In the german original we may refer to them as "Beliarpriester", "Vandranische Priester" etc.

* **Female Priests:** There is a significant percentage of female priests within the Beliar cult (few in the Adanos cult, none in the Innos cult), which tells something about the perception of woman and man in Myrtana (at least in tradition). The woman as bound more to the earth, as pointing downwards to the acknowledgement of our material nature, grounded in that nature; man as oriented towards heaven, pointing upwards to the sky, to the acknowledgement of our spiritual or transcendental nature; grounded in ideals. Obviously both is needed in union in order to materialise the spirit, in order to spiritualise the materia, to realise ideals and to "idealise" reality. But as one has been considered higher than the other and there was an exaggerated focus and identification of the physical male and female form with these internal principles, men started to look down upon women in course of the tides. 

**Restriction under Rhobar:** 

In the Comic it is said "bei Gotha" - at first I imagined it to refer to a saint, but it may as well be one of the early names of Mike for the gods besides Ra. In this case his names may have been Ra, Gotha and Adanos.  
That said, Gotha would be equated with Beliar and as such it would be like the ideal god of the "Goths" (in an archetypical sense), an archetypical gothic class that worships a dark god. 

As the worship of Beliar has been tried to be strictly controlled since the rule of Rhobar in order to limit the anarchic, anti-authoritarian currents within the cult, the Goths (in the before mentioned archetypical sense, not in a historical sense) - those people who may have worshipped Gotha, Beliar, primarily and didn't want to let themselves be restricted in their practice - were then forced to practice in secret and may seen as Pariahs by parts of society. 

These parts of the cult and these priests have often chosen forests as their refuge. Banned from society like the ones they ought to protect, excluded and looked down upon and feared like half-orcs, many live in solitude and basically form a sort of druid class in the phoenix universe. 


## Visual Design

* Just as Innos is associated with sound and in general with the "light of the senses", so is Beliar associated with silence and darkness, with the withdrawal of the senses. The withdrawal of the senses will be the essential characteristic of the design of the beliar priests. Therefore in their visual design we will put emphasis on these aspects of silence, of darkness, of earth, of going down and inside/retract instead of rising above and outside/unfold. -> Thus the Beliar priests often will wear dark earthen-coloured robes, sometimes made from archaic materials like unusually rough plant fibers, wood, bones and often fur. Most of the time they are wearing simple hats that are covering their ears, sheer blindfolds, veils or masks covering their eyes and sometimes their whole face 
* On the earliest concept by Ralf the demon summoner is shown with a blindfold too, which could be seen as leaning towards this dark side. 
* Beliar stands for justice: The priests of Beliar wear a blindfold just like Justitia and for the same or a similar twofold reason: As seeming to be blind to injustice, in the sense that they use to help especially those in hiding and in crime, under persecution etc., which can bring them into conflict with authority who seeks to get hold of and punish them (in earlier times though these people may have been send to these priests consciously in order for them to lead them inside, into remorse and purification through spiritual attacks against their (criminal) persona - they may have the idea that if someone does evil deeds it is due to his evil persona, which is an acquired mask that, metaphorically, has to be torn off his face. But also in the sense of impartiality, that they do not judge on superficial grounds and do not look for position in society or the history, they just look into what is facing them now and work on the effacement and renewal of their pain-stricken persona through facing the darkness within them.   
* In the same way the black guard of the Inquisition (seeing themselves as earthly executors of beliars justice) cover their eyes with a metal visor.
* Thus it is crucial for the Beliar priests to be presented accordingly. Basically, they do "not have a face", they are radically rejecting their persona, at least it is this where their traditional clothing is coming from (obviously there will as well be many priests just dressed in pride). Thus...

* It is a stance against individualism, and individualism in the sense of a fear of loosing ones self (and identification with the persona) can be associated with the fear of the people from the night and the neglect of Beliar and his principles that led to Beliar creating death to force them to accept his truth.
* The beliar cult is arguing that much suffering is caused by the peoples neglect of this crucial second side of life; they appreciate the bright side, the outside, the light, but not the dark, the inside, the night.
* Thereby a beliar priest is acting as a living example of this rejection and in resistance against this general "fault", the sin against the dark, as they see it. His looks is a slap into the face of ordinary people who always reminds them of death, of a possible and inevitable end, of the need to explore the internal life instead or alongside of conquering the outside world and so on.

**Relation to others:** Some people are afraid and aversed from them due to this, because they do not want to be reminded of death and of whats going on deep inside of them. They run away from it. Others are attracted to them as they find no sense and meaning anymore in the outside or as they are banned from the world and forced into hiding due to their crimes or their difference, for which they receive hatred and exclusion from society.

**Exile Priests as Druids:** Also because those among the before mentioned vandrani "priests" which went into exile due to the regime would not be part of the "clergy", the "official" priesthood, they may appear more druid-like (druids are non-clerical wizards). 

**Notes on the nature of Beliar magic:** A druid spell from D&D: "You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom." A druid/beliar mage can bring out bad potential stuff out of humans and harm them thereby. But he can also bring out other, positive potential in them, can influene and heavily speed up this process magically. He deals with whatever is to be found in the dark, turning good people evil and evil people good. The weakness, the shadows of others are their strength. They summon to the surface what they want to remain hidden and hide and restrict what others want to express.  

**"Conformist" Priests, Exile Priests and their Relation with the Orcs:** The difference between "conformist" priests who conform to the restrictions of the clergy - at least officially (they may still do other things in secret) - and those priests in exile who do not conform, are one of the reasons for the confusion regarding the association of Beliar and the Orcs. The Orcs have nothing to do with Beliar, they do not believe in him. It is a god of man, it is not a part of their history and tradition. So why some people may - wrongly - associate Beliar with the Orcs is because some Beliar priests have come to be associated with the Orcs or the Half-Orcs specifically. But they are not associated with them due to a common God they would believe in (although ofc, among the Half-Orcs may be many), but primarily because both have been banned from society. In that the Half-Orcs are among those who are looked down upon the most, who have to hide the most, who are feared and hated the most, alone already by virtue of their outer appearance, they are exactly what a Beliar priest is responsible to take care of. So they naturally found together.
