* Monks are religious ascetics living in a monastery or serving in a local temple.
* Some of them have the honour to receive initiation into the magic arts and are on the path to priesthood.
* Others start to study religious law and may later try to join the order of the inquisition.


### Attire

* Before ordination a new monk is clad in a simple ascetic robe which differs from order to order. Some give their initiates a naturally coloured linen tunic (reaching to the middle of the calves) that also remains his undergarment, signifying his new, clean life. Others clad them in just an old skirt from faded fabric with more focus on asceticism and humility. 

* Upon full ordination he receives a simple, long, hooded robe (such as the 0.56c Alpha Mage Robe or the robes seen in the intro to THIEF) with no adornment whatsoever.

* The colour of this robe varies from order to order and region to region, and in some cases it is different within a single order simply due to availability of the material. It can be a dark, washed-out green (see medieval east-european monks), brown (see medieval western monks), red (for fire orders, such as the woolen robe that Milten wears under his leather sash) or blue (for water orders). 

> _Let clothing be given to the brethren according to the nature of the place in which they dwell and its climate._
> _(…)_ _The monks should not complain about the color or the coarseness of any of these things, but be content with what can be found in the district where they live and can be purchased cheaply._ (Benedictine Order)


### Equipment

* Linen undergarment (3/4 tunic)
* Long woolen tunic of varied colour
* Cowl (hooded wrap covering most of the tunic like medieval benedictians or medieval eastern robes; in case of the monks of Khorinis it is red)
* Sandals
* A simple belt over the long tunic, but under the cowl
* Needle and thread to fix their garment (robes show visible signs of repair)
* A knife for various tasks
* A sword or small halberd (sufi style) in case of the monks of Khorinis after the order took over the district, basically making it a "military" order that combines the ideals of monk- and knighthood.

> _(…) the Abbot should provide all the necessary articles: cowl, tunic, stockings, shoes, belt, knife, stylus, needle, handkerchief, writing tablets;_ (Benedictine Order)
