## Initiation

* Members of the Circles are (in regular cases) former monks being initiated into some of the [magic arts](). Only a small percentage of monks are allowed initiation. But sometimes a master may also initiate worthy laymen without a clerical background at his own discretion. 
* Every initiated mage both of the circle of fire and water - at least formally - is also a priest in the ancient sense (not so much in the christian sense). But not every mage is actively involved in religious service in the temples of the realm. 
* [There are no priests of Beliar] 


## Livelihood & Lifestyle

* Some mages are serving as priests in a temple. 
* Some mages are completely focused on their magic art(s) under the grace of a lord which they serve as healers or battlemages, sometimes even as illusionists for entertainment at the court, or as scientists/alchemists; those mages are often very famous and wealthy.
* Some mages are working as technologists who use their knowledge and their magic skills and abilities to design machinery to serve manufacturing processes in the pre-industrial context (as in the ore factory); some may design war machinery and so on (think of Da Vinci).
* Some mages are living in monasteries among the monks.  
* Some mages live secluded on their own (think of the mage in a tower).
* Some are just living in villages or cities among the people, making their livelihood as healers or priests (without a temple).
* Some mages live a very ascetic lifestyle, while others live in luxury.

### Attire

* It is the sash that connotes said magical initiation (and to be in the process of becoming a priest, like Milten). 
* In difference to the simplistic uniform monk robes, the robes of mages are highly individualistic, sometimes using their former woolen monk robe as a basis (which is almost always the case for the renegade mages of Khorinis, emphasizing their explicitly ascetic nature) with a sash from leather (see Milten), wool or jute, at other occasions (as is the case with some arch mages in the colony or the mages of the king) being made from silk and sashes adorned with golden threads, showing off their wealth and status
* Sashes are connoting the rank of a priest and his magical specialisation in form of the runes on the sash, which in case of the renegade order [a placeholder name] is air magic.
* All mage robes, but especially those of the renegade mages, are roughly based on the robes of higher ranked medieval east european monks
* Some mages have their hood up, others down and some wear additional hats


### Equipment Mages of the Order of Khorin

* Linnen undergarment
* Monks tunic of varied colour
* Mage Cowl and sash combined with runic inscriptions referring to the magic specialisation (air magic in this case) and the orders history and tradition
* Hat (just two mages, one with the hood up, one with the hood down)
* Sandals
* Simple Staff (just one or two mages)
* Misc: Runes, Potions, Ore powder

TO story and costume design:
Milten may have been a "Lehrling" in the Comic,
but since the game he may have become an "Adept".
Or he may become one in course of the game;
him being entrapped may even have to do with his task.
Maybe him becoming an adept and you becoming a novice
or an apprentice may be somehow linked even. 
For example, a "Lehrling" may have some responsibility
for a novice; so he serves you and you serve him. 
But when he becomes an adept he cares more about his studies
and you become an apprentice of Corristo yourself.
---
In that case we can look at the Comic robe as an apprentice robe.
Specific characteristics are: The leather parts are brown, not black.
An initiate may not have any kind of clothing, or maybe just a skirt.
A Novice may have the beggar-like skirt + the novice poncho from G2.
An apprentice may have the brown sash, as if to suggest that it is
not yet "burned" by fire, which makes it black, and he has not any
adornments on his robe yet (so no flames etc. at the bottom). No amulet.

As an adept the sash is fully black (Miltens ingame robe) and first
adornments (flames at the bottom and arms) are added + the amulet. 

As a fire alchemist then, you get additional adornments and the
colours may turn around. 
As a novice and apprentice you wore a red robe + dark/black sash. 
Now, Drago wears the opposite: Black/brown robe and red sash. 
Same as the general high firerobe, which the "firemage" may wear.
Then Corristo is wearing a fully red robe again. 
Which would be the one of a master of fire. 

We can follow this scheme and design the robes individuality
around these principles; apart from these colours etc. we are
free to use different adornment, runes, belts, amulets, shapes
of the sash, material etc. Just the colour is roughly defined. 



Other mages:
Sandals or boots
Some may carry a (magical) staff
