Gothic, as any other game, was influenced by games made before.
The primary influences of Gothic in this regard were...

Ultima Underworld: The Stagian Abyss
System Shock
Thief

All three of them were made by Looking Glass.
All three were crucial steps in the development of
what we call today an 'immersive sim'. 

After those achievements by Looking Glass there were natural next steps to be taken and several developers attempted to take them with their games. Deus Ex, Arx Fatalis and Gothic were the main projects in that very tradition of that time (at least that I know about). 

The guys behind Arx Fatalis were primarily influenced by System Shock.
Raphael Colantonio wanted to make a Sequel to Ultima Underworld, but later it would become Arx Fatalis. 


The main idea of Harvey Smith mailed back and forth to Warren Spector wrote back and forth how "to take Ultima Underworld and blend it with System Shock". Finally their exchange led to the creation of Deus Ex (2000), but in the first stages of development they called it "Underworld with Guns". 


Arx Fatalis 2 was started to be developed based on the Source Engine of HL2, but was cancelled for financial reasons. Instead Arkane signed a deal with Ubisoft, where they made Dark Messiah and later - Dishonored and Prey (2017). But let's not go so far in history here. Other than that, I highly dislike the comicy, plastic-like artstyle of Dishonored. 



*Will there be a lot of interaction with the world and objects around you, ie. breaking down doors, shattering windows, chopping down a tree, etc.?*
**Michael Hoge:** Yes, you can. For example, hide in barrels, carry or push heavy objects, break doors - we don't have glass in our world, so you can't shatter windows, but anyway the main fun in GOTHIC is to interact with people rather than with stuff... (13.07.1999, ga-rpg.com)


*If something wrong happens in the storyline, will there be other outcomes you can find a solution to, or will you have to start over?*
**Michael Hoge:** No! Whatever you do, the game always continues. Worst case, everyone hates you and you'll have to bribe people to make them talk to you again! The player can be assured we won't let him down!

**Mike:** GOTHIC is like no other game. Imagine a mixture of Ultima Underworld (exploration), Abe's Odyssee (simple structure but lots of possible combinations), Fallout (atmosphere, no fairy-tale fantasy), Dungeon Master (consistent and logic world) and Tomb Raider (3rd person, only with a better camera). Different about GOTHIC is the (I hardly dare to say that) charcter's AI! Ok, ok, I know, everybody is telling that - so you'll just have to wait for the demo. GOTHIC characters have real memory. They will remember e.g. whether you've robbed them, knocked them down, helped them, etc. Moreover, they hear and tell news and will comment on your actions. They will be able to follow you if you climb walls, jump over canyons, swim, dive or whatever. They will do things you've never seen before in a computer game (in a positive sense ;) Another unique feature is the multiplayer game. (glideunderground.com 16.10.1999)



System Shock got rid of the dialogue trees from Ultima Underworld.

"The team believed that dialogue trees in the Ultima Underworld series were
like separate games in themselves that were disconnected from the main experience of being immersed into the environment. By deciding to eliminate dialogue, there'd be no need for living NPCs, and therefore the plot would be delivered by log discs and email messages". - Austin Grossman.

<p class="funfact">This would become one of the defining features of *shocklikes*, such as System Shock, BioShock and Prey.</p>



Gothic was started to being conceived in 1995, roughly at the same time
as other immersive sims like Deus Ex. And just like Deus Ex it was based on and inspired by these groundbreaking precursors.

The team behind Gothic had planned a system of disguise in 1999 that would have been very similar to what would later become a characteristic feature of Hitman (2000).


TODO: List all the typical immersive sim characteristics and in which sense Gothic was supposed to have them.









Important for this:
The video here about genres etc.:
"The Fallacy of the Immersive Sim":

"shocklike"
"soulslike"
"roguelike"
"gothiclike"

Player "Diegesis", at the example of Half Life:
1. "First Person Perspective" [-> We'll argue against it]
2. "Silent Protagonist" [-> same]
3. "No Forced Actions" [including no cinematics; we follow that]
4. "Explained Mechanics" [logical link between player, mechanics and gameworld]


Diegesis Wikipedia:
Diegesis (/ˌdaɪəˈdʒiːsɪs/; from the Greek διήγησις from διηγεῖσθαι, "to narrate") is a style of fiction storytelling that presents an interior view of a world in which:

1. Details about the world itself and the experiences of its characters are revealed explicitly through narrative.
2. The story is told or recounted, as opposed to shown or enacted.[1]
3. There is a presumed detachment from the story of both the speaker and the audience.



Important:
Differentiate between the 
World/A-Life Simulation aspect -> Morrowind, Gothic, Stalker
and the Immersion aspect that comes down to
Simplification of the Interface
Visualisation of the Mechanics/Progression
and the Interactivity
