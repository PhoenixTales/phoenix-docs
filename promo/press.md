## What Gothic Fans and Devs say about Phoenix

> **Auronen:** [...] I just wanted to work on games as amazing as G1, but games as these are not made nowadays. Only Phoenix wants to follow this (in game dev years) "ancient" tradition and that is amazing.

> **Flosha:** "What is your opinion about our project?" - **Tom Putzki:** "You are <span class="demonic">mad</span>. But in the most positive sense."

>  **Phantom:** This mod is made for true lovers of the alpha versions. It's almost the only hope that we will be able to experience this most mysterious and exciting atmosphere and the story of the alpha version. I've always dreamed about it.

<!--<blockquote>My re-discovery of Nyx and [the] Archive inspired me a lot! I've been terribly missing people expressing similar fixation with designs from Gothic I. -Avallach</blockquote>-->

> **Pioneer:** It has the same vibe as the first Gothic.

> **Larifari:** You're dealing with the past of something, you're researching and reconstructing. Like raiders of the lost ark, you're connecting the treasures that were thought to be lost to a great and harmonious whole. This is a very ambitious project...

<!-- > **Larifari:** Man setzt sich mit der Vergangenheit von etwas auseinander, forscht und rekonstruiert. Man ist Jäger des verlorenen Schatzes und fügt die verloren geglaubten Funde zu einem großartigen und stimmigen Gesamtkonstrukt zusammen. Das ist ein sehr ambitioniertes Projekt... -->
  
> **tefendy:** It's so damn greaaaat. Waiting with Uriziel in hand.

> **Avallach:** I am very proud to work on the first major Gothic mod being developed with sources publicly available on GitHub. I am not aware of any other attempt as good as Phoenix to research and reconstruct the original designs made for Gothic I.

> **Arbax:** A new era of how and what the real World of Gothic should have been from the beginning. [...] The more I read about the story and how it progresses, the bigger and more detailed it gets, it feels like a story with such a big potential, like a Greek or Sumerian myth with intrigue and so much plot development.

> **Avallach:** Regarding the Gothic Remake art design shift, I think one aspect worth pointing out is that they mistook the brutalism of Gothic I as a technical limitation rather than as a stylistic choice. Brutalism is raw, oppressive, overwhelming, severe, crude. Right at home in the Gothic 1 universe. / Flosha & Phoenix get it just right. / It's not a matter of low poly and primitive lighting. You can keep this style even with high poly and hd lighting. / It's not like that because they couldn't afford more polygons, it's a choice.
It's the opposite of cute and inviting. Maybe opposite of humanistic. It's meant to make you feel small, alone and alienated. (24.08.2025)
