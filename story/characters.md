# Character Names & Meanings (Act 1)

*flosha, 29.09.2024*  
*Last change: 11.02.2026*  

Here we want to give an overview of all the characters of our gothic drama. We list all names in their English, German and Polish version, according to the principle of translation of names as discussed in [/lore/nicknames](/lore/nicknames). They're structured in factions and guilds. More languages may be added later. 

After listening all the NPCs we offer an NPC short *description*, based on (1) what we know about them from all the sources and (2) what we can additionally derive via reflections about their names, be it by what their prison nicknames may tell about them, be it by what we find from an etymological perspective or be it by comparison with characters of the same name in other media that they may have been inspired by. 

What we will not address here is how the characters will develop in course of the story; this is the topic of the "Character Plots", starting with the Character Progression. "Characters" is the story-equivalent to "NPCs" in the game mechanics section. While in NPCs we have described how NPCs function internally in an abstract way, here they are in their concrete expression as characters in the game.

And please note: For now we are only listing all the names to be found in the sources, in some cases there are two names that may later be identified with the same character and we have yet to decide which name to use or how to solve these conflicts.

### Barons

| ENGLISH  | DEUTSCH    | POLISH      |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Gomez    | Sangwah?   | "           |
| Raven    | Krah(wah)  | Kruk        |
| Scar     | Narwah     | Blizna      |
| Bartholo | "          | "           |
| Vasquez  | Watzka?    | "           |
| Santino Garcia | Garxa? | "         |
| Arto, Wardog | Arth(ur), Kriegshund | ", Brytan |
| The Keeper | Der Wächter | Nadzorca  |

```
* Bartholo // "Außenminister", "Schatzmeister"
* Gomez    // "Big Boss"
* Raven    // "Schattenbaron", "Rechte Hand"
* Santino  // surname Garcia
* Scar     // "Söldnerbaron", "Linke Hand"
* Vasquez  // "Grauer Baron"
* Wardog   // "Konvoiführer", "Jungbaron"
* TheKeeper // Orchunter, dead/Zombie
* Sangwah  // nickname/german name of either Gomez or Vasquez
```

* **Gomez** "is a common Spanish patronymic surname of Germanic origin meaning "son of Gome". [...] Gome is derived from the Visigothic word guma, man." 
* **Santino Garcia**. Garcia could be called "Garxa" in German. While Santino is a very popular name in the respective regions and means as much as "little saint", there is no direct german translation or equivalent, that would fit, but "Siegfried" or "Heinrich" would convey a similar feeling and a similar "Würde" in a german context. Thus "Heinrich Garxa" could be considered a germanic equivalent.
* **Vasquez** could be called "Watzka" in German, as some czech-germans used it as an equivalent name.
* **Scar** instead of translating him as *Narbe* in German could also be translated as *Schmiss* or in the old high german form Narwa. This has the advantage that we could also change it into "Narwah" and have then something close to "Sangwah" in style.
* **Raven** could be translated literally as *Rabe*, but he could as well be called *Krah*, which is similar to the Polish name *Kruk*, which sounds well and is a german surname that reminds of "Krähe" (crow) and resembles their sound. Other than that also a new creation such as "Krahwah" is imagineable. 
* **Bartholo** comes from Bartholomew, in German Bartholomäus, which comes from Bar-Talmai, which means "son of Talmai". More germanic sounding forms could be "Barthalar", "Barthalah", "Barthola(r/h)", "Barthomar" or simply "Bartha".  
* **Arto** is supposed to mean as much as "bear", it can be directly translated into German as "Arthur" or alternatively simply as "Arth", which is the common root. 


### Slaves

* Balam
* Elvira
* [Servant]
* [Joker] 
* Omid 
* Seraphia
* Syra
* Velaya

```
The names of the female slaves don't have to be translated.

Balam   // Cook of the barons
Omid    // Cook of the barons
```

* **Balaam** is a biblical name of a prophet.
* **Omid** is a persian/kurdish name meaning "hope".
* **Joker:** No name found yet.
* **Servant:** No name found yet.

#### Outside Ring Mercs

| ENGLISH         | DEUTSCH            | POLISH      |
|-----------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Fletcher        | Fleschner  | ???         | 
| Jackal          | Schakal            | Szakal         |
| Bloodwyn        | Bladwin            | ???         |
| Nek             | ???                | ???         |
| Rigosh Twoknife | Rigosch Zweimesser | ???         |
| Snore           | Schnarcher         | ???         |

```
Fletcher  //
Jackal    //
Bloodwyn  //
Nek       // dead Guard, ...
Rigosh    // Nickname "Twoknife"?
Snore     // sleeps at the Gate
```

* **Bloodwyn:** May be kept untranslated. Alternative ideas. Mix with blood, mix of blood/blossom, Blut/Blüte -> Blüter? Or "Bluter" or "Blutwein". But if we understand the "wyn" like in "Marvin", then it can mean something like "loving" blood. If so, then simply "Der Blutrünstige" would be fitting or simply germanising the name, so that its spelled "Blutvin" in German with almost the same pronounciation, just not as english. // As it seems, an earlier of the name can be found in the documents as Bladwin, which clarifies the meaning (same as Baldwin, as it seems) and also offers the exact same pronouncation as the English Bloodwyn in German and with a more german appearing name. 
* **Fletcher:** To fletch means "befiedern"; Fletcher could thus be translated as "Fiederer" in German. On the other hand it reminds of the German "(Zähne) fletschen", as it sounds the same, which in English means "to bare ones teeth"; he could thus be translated as "Fletscher", which fully preserves the sound and may fit in meaning better than his English name. At the same time in french it is called "flechner" and there is the german name "Fleschner" which can mean, for example, as much as "Butcher" from flesh, german "Fleisch". In this sense, the name could have an almost cynical meaning, in the sense that he wasn't an arrow-maker, who puts feathers onto something ("befiedern"), but rather removed the feathers from e.g. the animals (mainly vultures, if they had feathers...) that he kills and prepares for the cooks. It is also fitting since a butcher is lacking in the OC so far. 
* **Nek:** "Nek" is an allusion to "Death". Can either be kept in all languages or translated to something similar with the same allusion.

```
SECRET    // "Der Unsichtbare", Leader
Dark(man) // "Der Assassine"
Viper     // Meuchler 1
Snogu     // Meuchler 2
?         // Meuchler 3
Earl      // "Das Ohr", Masterspy
Phantom   // Spy 1
Nimble    // Spy 2, "Flinkhand"

Dexter    // "Der Hehler"

Shad(ow)  // "Kontakter"
```

* **Phantom:** Etymologically related to "fantasy", from latin phantasia (“imagination”), which in turn comes from ancient Greek φαντασία (phantasía, “apparition”), from φαντάζω (phantázō, “to render visible”), from φαντός (phantós, “visible”), from φαίνω (phaínō, “to make visible”); from the same root as φάος (pháos, “light”); ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *bʰh₂nyéti, from the root *bʰeh₂- (“to shine”). Interpretation: It is funny how something that means "to make visible" has ultimately turned into an illusion in form of "phantom", it is apparently visible, but not to the eyes; this ambivalent kind of meaning is the very same as in the German "Schein". Something that "erscheint" is something that is obviously seen, just as the english "shine", but it is at the same time what in English is described as "to seem" - it may as well be an illusion, only *seems* to be. But as a nickname, "Schein" doesn't seem like a good solution. *Schein* comes from Middle High German schīn, Old High German scīn, skīn (“shine, brightness, light, ray”), from Proto-West Germanic *skīn, from Proto-Germanic *skīną. Cognate with Old Norse skína, Old Saxon scīnan, Old English sċīn (“phantom, ghost”), Dutch schijn, English shine, Gothic 𐍃𐌺𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌰𐌽 (skeinan). Therefore, in German: Skeinar, das Fantom? Skeinar as his real name, Fantom/Phantom as his nickname.
* **Snogu:** To "snog" is slang and means as much as "to kiss" and to hold someone sexually. Based on this idea Snogu could be something like "Küsser", "Necker", but "Snogger" would be a more fitting nickname in that case... What could Snogu mean other than that?
* **Earl:** A literal translation in meaning would be "Jarl" or "Graf", but *Earl* as a word contains "ear" (which is his nickname, "the Ear") and it can be assumed to be on purpose, as it reminds of his role (of being the "ear" of the Barons in the sense of their most important spy); we therefore choose a name that contains the German "Ohr" in a similar way to "Earl" containing "ear". This let us think of "Orell" or "Orel" from Aurelius, "Orl" or "Oran". 
* **Grag:** See "Grag and Otto" (google search), or Otho, may thus be kept and used as an allusion to that. Maybe Half-Orcs too?

Drexel  // Maybe an earlier name for Drax, therefore maybe combine it with Drax as its German name instead of a separate NPC? Check.
Bruce   // Organiser, which in CH1 hangs around at the marketplace of the Old Camp. 
```

* **Gaist**: Sounds identical to the german "Geist" (ghost), based on which we could identify him with the alpha NPC "Phantom", but Gaist is an Organiser in the novel, while Phantom most likely was a Shadow. When still holding on to this possible identity, he would have to be a double agent, but this does not fit the character description and style of Gaist; therefore we prefer to conceptualise them as different characters, which makes it difficult to translate both of them.
* **Bruce**: The name comes from *Robert the Bruce* (Scottish Gaelic: *Raibeart am Brusach*), based on this we could either germanise him as Brusach or simplify it to just Brus or Brusa. In french: Brus.


### NC Folk

```
Homer      // Builder of the Dam and the "Beavercastle"
Jeremiah   // Ricelord
Lefty      //
...
```

* **Homer:** Literally "Taube" in German = Brieftaube, ala "Nestbauer", alternatively a better fitting name in German would be "Biber" (Beaver), as the "Builder of the "Beavercastle" of the NC.
* **Shrike:** In German either Fink (beides Sperlinge) oder "Spießer" wegen der Bedeutung des Namens und dem Verhalten des Vogels
* **Russel:** We may choose Rotger as his German equivalent. It is an old German name, nowadays most often spelled Roettger, with spelling variations like Ruder, Rodger, Rotheger, Rotoga, Reutter and *Russer*. Russer would also work, as it comes closer to the english original.

* **Judex**: Originally named "Judas" in the documents. To avoid using this biblical name and all its associations we renamed him into Judex, based on the anti-hero of the same name.

```
Drexel: Maybe an earlier name for Drax, therefore maybe combine it with Drax as its German name instead of a separate NPC? Check.
Dagger: Messer, besser als Dolch?
Craven: Reminds of "Craving", could thus be associated with German "Sehnsucht", "Verlangen", "Begierde" etc., such as in a name like "Sehner" etc.

> King Oruc, fearing Patience or Peace could be a danger to his reign, keeps them under control by allowing only one of them to leave the castle at a time. However, this delicate hostage situation falls apart when Peace becomes ill. Before he dies, Patience cuts into Peace's shoulder to retrieve a crystal globe hidden under his skin. "The scepter of the Heptarchs," he says. "Never let a gebling know you have it."   
> Only moments after Peace dies, King Oruc sends an assassin after Patience. She easily dispatches him and leaves the castle, stopping to visit her father's preserved head in Slaves' Hall, where the heads of the wisest people are kept alive by headworms. Since the heads are coerced to speak only the truth, Patience forces her father to divulge his darkest secrets.   
> Peace reveals that since Patience's birth, he had been fighting a powerful compulsion to bring her to Cranning, home of the geblings. The "Cranning Call", as it was known, drew the world's greatest thinkers and achievers to make a pilgrimage to Cranning, never to be seen or heard from again. Peace says the source of the Call is the Unwyrm, attempting to summon Patience to his lair.   
* The Mad Scientists also used Cranwater as a location, "Cran" as a folk/race and Unwyrn too, being heavily inspired by the novel.  
> She relives the moment when the Starship Captain, lured through lust to the surface, mates with the Wyrm in its lair beneath a glacier that would later become Cranwater.
