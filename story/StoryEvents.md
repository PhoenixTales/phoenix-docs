These *Story Events*, described by Tom as "profound changes", are directly linked to the so called *Guild Attitudes*. They are a representation of the changes occuring in the world as a consequence of these story twists, in form of changes in the relationships between guilds. We had no documentation of the events, but we had the respective attitudes. A careful study of those attitudes would help us to understand the initial relationships as well as deduce potential implications associated with the events, that we may not have had seen before. There were four events we know of (the description is from me and based on our current knowledge which we didn't have at this stage of development):

```
OMFull       // Collapse of the Old Mine 
FMTaken      // Gomez’ attack of the Free Mine 
OrcAssault   // The Orc’s Storm of the Surface
Nemesis      // Madness in the dawn of the Awakening
```

Among these events, only FMTaken made it into the release version of Gothic, which was united with OMFull. Thus, instead of four “profound changes”, instead of four to five important story twists, the game ended up with *one*. We knew that the original idea was, that the collapse of the Old Mine happened directly after (and in fact was caused *by*) the Great Prayer of the Brotherhood, at the end of Chapter 2, while the Free Mine was to be taken at the end of Chapter 3. I also knew, intuitively (and we could confirm this later when we received the main plot document of the original Phoenix Concept) that the *OrcAssault* should happen with the opening of the temple, when the Orcs flee in fear of the awakening. But we did not knew what *Nemesis* was about.  
Among alpha researchers there were various theories, most of them circulating around the orcs and the idea that the assault of the orcs and their occupation of a camp were supposed to be two separated events. For example it was speculated that when the orcs would appear on the surface, they would at first *siege* the Old Camp, before they would *occupy* it in Nemesis. But I was convinced that Nemesis had to mean something else and something more. Something very different. And since there is no other hint in the scripts, we could only draw conclusions from the before mentioned guild attitudes.

There are four attitudes from guild to guild:
*Friendly* (X), *Neutral* (X), *Angry* (X) and *Hostile* (X).
In the release version (v1.06), the OrcAssault and Nemesis attitudes were removed from the scripts. But they were still present in 1.01. Other than in the scripts of the release version, the tables in this Beta consisted only of the respective numbers though. They contained no descriptions and were very hard to read.  
Upon my request, Nex, one of Phoenix' Contributors, created tables of all the attitudes, in which the numbers were replaced by the respective descriptions, as a basis for further research. You find his tables in the Appendix (ATTITUDE_*.xlsx).  

Working with the tables he created I started to study the attitudes profoundly. I decided to analyse them from chapter to chapter and to describe them not by analysing every single guild in isolation, which wouldn't have been very informative, but by differentiating between intra- and inter-camp attitudes, (e.g. attitudes between guilds of the same camp and attitudes between guilds of different camps). This made it a lot shorter and a lot more informative at the same time. I then added relevant differences in the attitudes from v1.01 to v1.06, wrote a summarised interpretation to each chapter, compared the chapters and concluded the study with a final, general summary.
