### How many survive?

We know from the documents that at the later stages of the story (after FMTaken), the old camp would get emptier and emptier. Some miners die during the collapse of the Old Mine - probably not as many as one would expect due to the Final Prayer happening at dusk. Some defect to the Free Camp (Chapters 1-3) and some defect to the Sect (Chapters 1-4). Some begin to work in the Free Mine when it's taken; while the camps fight against each other on the surface; there is the revolt against the barons rule, the Free Mine is stormed by Orcs, the Old Camp is attacked and in the end, the madness waves lead to massacres.

It is to be expected that after all of these events (mine-war, revolt, orc assault and nemesis, culminating in the bloodnight) only about a fifth of the NPCs of Act I will survive; in case of the minor guilds like sect novices, diggers and scrapers it may be less; and it may be less for the Mafia (barons, shadows and guards alike) due to the particular impact on them in the story. 

We expect that from the ~415 NPCs in Act I, there will be ~10-15 Psionics, ~10 BDL/WRK, ~5 Shadows, ~15 Guards, ~5 Mercs, ~3 Organisers, ~5 Peasants, ~5 Mages, ~5 Rangers, ~5 Scrapers and ~5 "others" who may or may not survive. So the player may get so see at most ~78 familiar faces in Act II.
