# Varantin

**Author:** *Flosha*  
**Created:** ...

* Loosely inspired by the khazars, or in general turkic people of the steppe, their traders are shown in respective clothing of that period and their mercenaries in respective armour.
* In order to show their "foreign" character, they should be speaking in their own language and use their own script and speak german/english with an accent.
* We could use the _"Khazarian Rovas"_ or some variation of it. If the player wants to read it, he has to learn the signs and decipher the meaning or ask an NPC to do it for him. For the language we do not really know how the language of the Khazars sounded like. Research suggests that it may have been similar to todays [chuvash language](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=I5ZJT20qloI&pp=ygUVbWFuIHNwZWFraW5oIGNodXZhc2gg).

## Attire

* They are wearing shoes that are running conically to the tip (a short one, not a long tip). They are wearing tunics with specific ornamentation, wide loose pants and often khazar specific hats.
* Light warriors wear a simple helmet with a tail on the peak (with a nasal bridge?). Some have a mail armour. Medium warriors may have a lamellar armour on top.

* Heavy warriors (above) wear a longer tunic with their lamellar armour reaching further down, their face hidden by a mail cover. They're often wearing a coat with discreet varantian adornment. -> These heavy warriors are rare and are guarding the leaders of the varantian trader guild.

* The varantin have very skilled archers, as mounted archery is part of their cultural tradition. Some archers are patrolling the roofs of the varantian quarters. Many are guarding the outside of the trading center as well as the balconies inside.
