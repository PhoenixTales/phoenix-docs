## Levels by Chapters

In a handwritten note (Orpheus-B-Scribbles page 10) Mike identifies the player levels 1 to 3 with the "Orientation phase". And at least from Story v3 onwards this orientation phase was always identified with Chapter 1 (and we do not have mentionings of chapters before that). 

Mike also mentions (Orpheus-B-Scribbles page 15) that the eight "lower" guilds have levels "1-7", while the four "higher" guilds have the levels "1-END", which *may* either mean that 7 was not meant to be the end and that there were a few more levels until the end - but if so, why then is the number of these levels mentioned nowhere? - or it may mean, and we assume so, that the player would just progress within his guild or class to level 7 as the maximum level at which he would join one of the higher guilds like as a reward. While the mentioning of levels "1-END" in the context of the higher guilds may just be written in the context of lower level NPCs within these guilds. 

As seen in [Options of Defection](), a switch to another guild was set by Mike in the majority of cases to a maximum of level 3. When we interpret this in the context of Story V3 onwards, we could thereby conclude, that a change of the guild was needed to happen as early as within Chapter 1 and would not have been possible anymore (in most cases) in Chapter 2. 

But on the other hand it does not seem reasonable to interpret it this way, because in the Orpheus notes the orientation phase seems to have been just a rough idea for everything before the Psi Ritual that leads to the flood of the Old Mine. In the context of the later story, this would then encompass both Chapter 1 and Chapter 2. 

According to these same notes, during players progression from levels 4-6, the Psi Ritual would take place, the mine would collapse due to it, the Old Camp would attack the Free Mine and the OC and NC be at war; this is what in Story v3.3 would equal the Chapters 3 and 4. 

The player levels 6-7 would then be reserved for the "open fights" between the camps, the orc assault, the total chaos in the colony and the massacres that we know as Nemesis, the Chapters 5 and 6. 

But at this early point in development, it was not clear when the orcs should come to the surface and as written above, chapters were not mentioned yet. In the beginning of the Phoenix concept the story was then divided into 5 chapters instead of 6; these five chapters are mentioned in the Phoenix Pitch. 

When we'd go with the 5 chapter solution while orienting ourselves at Mikes handwritten story notes, the relation between player levels and chapters may for instance present itself like this:

```
1   0-1      // Orientation. Joins a guild.     
2   2-3      // Can still change, then PsiRitual
3   4-5      // First OMFull, then FMTaken at the end
4   6-7      // Mine War, OrcAssault, Higher Guild
5   END      // Nemesis and Showdown
```

The six chapter solution could look like this:

```
1   1-2     // Orientation
2   2-3     // PrepareRitual
3   3-4     // OMFull
4   4-5     // FMTaken
5   5-6     // OrcAssault
6   6-7     // Nemesis/Showdown
```

But there is one problem with that: We know, that level 6 or even 7 in many cases were described as a *requirement* to join one of the higher guilds. Therefore it makes no sense that the player would reach level 7 only in the last chapter, as there would be no time anymore to build any bond to the new guild. The six chapter solution must therefore look different, for instance, like this: 

```
1   0-2     // Orientation
2   2-4     // PrepareRitual
3   4-5     // OMFull
4   5-6     // FMTaken
5   7-      // OrcAssault
6   END     // Nemesis/Showdown
```

Independent from the five or six chapter structure, we can assume that in general it would be up to Chapter 2 that the player should still have been able to potentially turn around his previously choosen class, while at least from Chapter 3 onwards the decision for a class would be fixed. 


## Guild Ranks

In [Joining Conditions](/story/factions/guilds-joining-conditions) I have pointed out how in the early conception phase there was the idea of a level system within guilds and I thought that it may correspond to ranks within the guild and that it may also make sense that it is linked at least to some degree to the chapters. The original developers said so themselves, when speaking of the multiplayer mode:

[Add: Mike and Tom about the Multiplayer, where Tom identifies it with the chapters]

I made the example that a thug of level 5 may be thrown out of the guild, then join the sect and be a novice of level 1. By this example I suggested that these levels were linked to the guild and would not persist when joining a different guild. And in this case this may be true. But a more precise and perhaps more logical explanation would be to assume that the level is primarily linked to the *class*. 

It may be possible to join a totally different class throughout the story, if one has no other option. But usually, as in the example of the shadow: a thief will most likely defect to another thief guild from another camp. As we know, he can be up to level 5 for defecting to the Orgas; thus having reached quite a high rank in his guild already and alongside having reached quite some skill as a thief. Here we have to assume that in such a case the level would persist and carry-over to an equivalent or similar rank in the new guild he defects to.

As far as we know, up to 7 maximum levels were planned per guild. If that is the case, how may they relate to the chapters, which were 6? In order to clarify this, we first have to point out that the player was meant to start not with level 1, but with level 0 (being guildless and of no rank or name whatsoever inside of the prison system).

Additionally, the 7 levels are linked to the 8-9 guilds that the player could join within the first chapter, but he would not (necessarily) belong to one of these guilds till the end of the game. Somewhere at the last quarter of the game (I assume probably in chapter 5) he would join one of the four so called "higher", "secret" guilds. 

It is unlikely that these higher guilds were also supposed to have 7 levels that the player would progress through; not only due to their narrative meaning, where you are already of a high rank just by belonging to one of these elite groups, but also due to the point in time within the story, where the player focuses on solving the game. It does not seem plausible to me that he was supposed to go through 7 different ranks within the two final chapters. And at least in the Guild System documents it is indeed the case that the 7 levels are only ever mentioned in regard to the regular guilds, not the higher ones. We simply don't know how much they were meant to have (or if any!) and how these levels were supposed to function. 



A conclusion that stands to reason would be to choose the same number as the attribute levels, which are 10 (or 0 + 9). In this case, examplatory guild ranks throughout the story could roughly look like this:


```
+-----+------------+     +---------+
| Lvl | Rank       |     | Chapter |
|-----|------------|     |---------|
|  0  | Noname     |     |    1    |
|  1  | Initiate   |     |         |
|  2  | Novice     |     |    2    |
|  3  | Apprentice |     |         |
|  4  | Adept      |     |    3    |
|  5  | Alchemist  |     |         |
|  6  | Mage       |     |    4    |
|  7  | Master     |     |         |
+-----+------------+     |    5    |
|  8  | Disciple   |     |         |
|  9  | Witcher    |     |    6    |
+-----+------------+     +---------+

```

In "options of defection" I have described the basic scheme into which the early ideas from Mike fit. According to these ideas, apart from the thief, who could defect to another thief guild throughout the game, the class was not really taken into account as a factor.

The only factors were:
* Players should have some freedom to change their minds early on (in Mikes case, the simple standard for this was "up to level 3").
* The relationships between the guilds should be a relevant consideration for the ability to join, regarding trustworthiness, loyalty etc.

What we do in Phoenix is
* to take the relationships more serious (which will also make the first point tighter and in many cases lower the maximum level for a switch) and
* add the class as a third factor.

Our system will then look like this:

* Players will be given a little bit of freedom to change their minds about their class, mostly limited to level 1, instead of 3, as the default.
* Players will get the option to switch to other guilds of the same class at different points of the story, probably up to level 5, which should always be linked to specific narrative reasons. For example, the player may be confronted with a decision or a mission or task, which he is not ready to do and decides to betray his guild at this point in time and defect to the other group. And such possibilities should be given not only once in course of the story, but several times.
* These options of defaction are restricted and individualised based on relationships. For instance, a shadow will have a harder time or more convincing to do to join the Orgas than an Orga will have to do to join the Rangers, and joining the rangers will be limited to a lower level for the shadow etc.
* While Mike considered such options for the thief, mostly due to the double agent idea, he did not do so in regard to the warrior. In our case, switching from thugs to templars or vice versa and templars to mercs etc. should be an option, while thug to merc may be fairly restricted due to the bad relationships.

The ranks cannot really be divided equally throughout the chapters (for this we would need to have just 6 total levels or 12; which we have no reason to imagine), *unless* we do not think of the chapters as 6, but as 5 chapters, as described in the Phoenix Pitch.

If we assume 5 chapters, the guild progression would roughly be 2 levels per chapter. And it could very well be that this whole "10" levels idea for every attribute and other statistics from the alpha was first developed with the 5 chapters in mind. But even if so, the guild ranks do not necessarily have to be spread out evenly over the chapters. The progression through the guilds has to happen alongside the progression through the main story, but not necessarily in a fully symmetrical and fixed kind of way.

## Exiled Mages

According to Mikes Orpheus guild concepts mages of the two circles would have to remain guildless if being banned from their circle between level 4-6, as they could only defect to the other circle up to level 3, while the Demon Summoner only accepts Mages of level 7. 

We will divert from this by giving the option, similar to the release version, of at least defecting to the other mages circle at up to level 4 or 5. (Although this may only be possible if the reason for the ban is not a crime that the other circle despises just as much.)  

Additionally: While on the regular path the Mage can only join the Demon Summoner after having reached level 7, being exiled from the circles may work to his advantage in the dark arts by raising his esteem in the eyes of the Demon Summoner and thus may allow him to become his disciple earlier.
