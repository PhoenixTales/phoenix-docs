In this document I want to trace all the joining missions for every guild, from the first mentionings in the concepts to the release version. 



## Orpheus

We will begin with the handwritten notes by Mike, which contain only a few ideas for these missions for a few of the guilds. I translate and list them here.

* Orpheus-B-Scribbles does not contain any notes for missions that can particularly be seen or are connoted as joining missions.



### Guild System V1

Battlemages (KDF): PC needs extraordinary magical talent, which he acquires from teachers. Has to demonstrate a Magic Missile.

Thugs (GRD): The thugs take everyone who can stand one's ground and is not suspected to be a traitor. The PC needs X Fighter XP and demonstrate his experience through a battle in the arena.

Snitches (STT): Admission test, when fulfilled PC is offered membership. 

Healing mages (KDW): PC needs to demonstrate Cure Spell. 

Mercenaries (SLD): Fighter XP.
















 They may not necessarily seem to be related to joining the guilds, but in our design philosophy nothing should just be a side mission with no relation to the main story or the guilds. The player has a strong motivation to break out of the prison and everything he does should have some connection to this goal. Also: Every mission is given by an NPC with some relation to a guild and so whatever the player is doing, will of course have to affect his relation to the guilds and so it must obviously also affect his ability to join.


## Midcity / Liberal Camp (Old Camp)

> Motivation for Missions?
> Power struggles ("Machtkämpfe")
> Benefit fights ("Vergünstigungskämpfe")
> Person abducted ("Person entführt")
(Orpheus-B-Scribbles, p.12)

In another note he mentions the idea of:
> Surveillance [of the PC] through NPCs
(Orpheus-B-Scribbles, p.12)

## General Quest ideas by Mike for the game

> Organise a sack of ore - no matter from where
> Kill NPC X - defected from the Sect
> Protect Miner(s) at work
> NPC X has been lost in Dungeon - find him
> Miner has lost item in old Mine, bring it to him
> In Caves under the fields are Minecrawlers -> bad for crops
> Vision: Getting Artefact of Resurrection from old Temple
> Keep cave for X (hit pole with sword)
> Find out what secret passages are under the PSI temple
> In the swamp is a monster: Kill it (in the evening)
> NPC X has item Y -> Get it [Key Drawing]
> summoned Demon in cave system X
> Diggersfort [FC] is sieged by Soldiers [GRD]
> Rob Ore Convoy
> Mafiachief [Mafiafürst] lusts after item X - get it
> Guy wants his chick back (she is in the Psi Camp)
> You need to kill Fighter X in the arena (has rebelled against Junta)
> He has stolen it from me, bring it back to me
> Escort X to Y (he is at Z)
> Find X (Detective) and bring him to Y
> I want to defect! (2 slots ready / 1 always taken)
> Must steal something, but a thief is already there... [new mission]
> Eavesdrop a conversation, as the two are knowing *me*
