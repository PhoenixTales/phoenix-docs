# Story Summary

In this article I will only summarise the most essential missions and the logic behind the story as it was planned in different story conceptions. Side quests with no direct relation to the story progress are not contained. This way the reader gets a general idea of how the story was meant to be. 

As of now only the Story 3.3 is summarised. We will add the Orpheus story fragments and the Phoenix Main Mission story later and make a comparison of them all.

* Secret Path with an Orc Collaborateur in the Natural Caves closer to the AM -> Orc Companion bringing him into the City
-> Goal: Liberate Craven (Benedict in the Gothic Novel) in the Orc Prison, which is a friend of the DMB, [Flosha: e.g. he may have been send by him to the Orcs to find out stuff; a spy for the DMB] that brings you into contact with him.

**Chapter Content Summary:**
* Priority 2: Assassinate or rescue the Enlightened.
* OC STT: Assassinate the Enlightened.
* OC GRD: Not decided yet, but most apparently related to the FMTaken Plan.
* OC KDF: Was not decided yet.
* NC ORG: Assassinate the Enlightened instead of the Shadow to get the reward.
* NC KDW/GRD: Rescue the Enlightened, kill Assassin -> Y'Berion realises his illusion -> suicide
* PSI TPL: Protect the Enlightened/Temple.
* PSI Nov: Was not decided yet.

* Priority 1: Exploring OrcCaves
* PSI: Power struggle between Angar and Kalom -> Kalom new leader after his DrugBaron plot against Y'Berion with OC, Angar wants revenge. Extreme drug shortage, no deliveries to other camps -> therefore: PSI: Player is send to the OrcCaves with a PSI expedition to find the Temple, Main Mission.
(Priority 1); as Tpl additionally: Search Minecrawler Queen in Orc Caves due to drug shortage (Priority 2); the expedition dies soon; player has to continue alone or with his friends.
* OC/NC: Player is send to the OrcCaves for other reasons and to lookout for the temple while he's on it (essentially the same Priority 1 mission disguised as a Priority 2 mission); the reasons for NC/OC characters to be send to the OrcCaves were not yet defined (with the exception of the thief characters, see below). 
* OC STT: Find the leader of the OC Mercs (later Thorus) in the collapsed OM to get his key to the armoury of the OC [Flosha: can probably have survived depending on what?] -> the collapse opened up a passage to the natural Caves;
the search for the leader leads Stt into the OrcCaves -> his body close to the Orc Prison. 
* OC GRD: GRD was not defined, but he could have a similar reason; instead of looking for the leader due to his key, as the Shadow does, he may look for his leader to rescue him. 
* NC Org: Plundering the remnants of the OM [Flosha: Das nutzen, um von da bei einer Flucht in den Natural Caves der FM zu enden?]; finding the OC Merc leader to get his key before the shadows find him -> same path as the shadow, different reasoning and course. 
* NC Guard: Help the Scrapers in the FM (Protection against Orc Attacks; NC Guards and Templars are already there at the narrow passage to the Orc Caves -> asked to help the Guards and Templars against the Orcs. -> find the MST
* NC KDW: Find the MST for Saturas because the MST is a friend of the DMB.

Prio 3:
* OC GRD: Attack a Convoy from FM to NC.
* PSI TPL: Send to the OC Arena Battles.
