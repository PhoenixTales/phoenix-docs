In this article we will at first deal with the facts about the guild and its design known from the different concept sources and builds, with both the relevant background story of the guild as well as the general appearance of members of the guild (in form of the armour design). At the end of each section we will put all of it together to summarise how we will present the guild in PHOENIX. What we will not consider here are the individual characters of the guild and their role; this will be done in the character section in /story. 


## Name

They were first described as "Gladiators" on the first sketches, then as "noble Mercenaries" in *Guild System V1*, then as "Paladins" in *Guild System V2*, then as the "Guard" (of the Watermages) in the Alpha versions until ~v0.7 and finally as the "Mercenaries" of the Mages, when the names of the NC and OC fighter guilds were switched (the mercenaries of the orebarons were renamed to "Guard"). 


## Characteristics

The Guild System and Sequel docs inform us, that they...
* hate the Outside World and are "haters of the King"
* are based in the New/Gladiator Camp and protect the camp
* protect the healing mages and are healed for free
* protect the free diggers by order of the mages
* protect the peasants and receive food for free
* tolerate the ore thieves 
* believe in the escape plan of the healing mages
* are the *best* lower fighters guild (better than TPL & GRD; the only fighters stronger than them are barons, the only "higher" fighters guild).
* teach *all* melee fighting techniques 
* teach healing spells lev 1-3 and "natural healing"
* can be joined when having enough fighting experience

Mike deemed it important, that the player is informed, that they...
* are the best fighters in the colony apart from the ore barons
* hate the outside world "sympathisers" or collaborators

* In Story 3.3 it is mentioned that they have a "Kodex" (when the player joins the guild), Lee says: "From now on you are subject to our code to death. There is no more going back for you [...]"

* According to *NPCs per Guild*, they were originally supposed to consist of 24 people. 8 of them at most were meant to have the above-mentioned basic healing skills given by the mages. The remaining 16 were not meant to have any magical capabilities.

#### V2

**What they say about others:**
* (OC) Junta: Barons? Licksplitters of the outside world we call you. 
* (OC) Battlemages: Do not dare to threaten us.  
* (OC) Thugs: Ragtag! One of us on two of you and we win. 
* (OC) Snitches: Get lost and tell your boss he may lick my...
* (OC) Diggers: Coward working drones. 
* (NC) Healingmages: Good that we're not dependent on medicine from the Outside World.
* (NC) Orethieves: We have to work with you, but don't have to revel with you.
* (FC) Secret Thieves Guild: ? [They don't know about it]
* (FC) Rangers: For that they are single rangers, they make a good job.
* (FC) Free Diggers: Honest workers. 
* (FC) Halforcs: Dumb, but tough. 
* (PSI) Gurus: Scary Figures, they're in league with the evil / decadent. 
* (PSI) Novices: Those Blinded with their offers are no temptation for us.
* (PSI) Templars: Wake up - you could become good paladins/mercs. 
* Evocator: The healing mages will know why they are so careful.
* Outside World: We are your slaves no longer!

**What others say about them:**
* (OC) Barons: Those peasants could have an easier life, good fighters, but not enough.
* (OC) Thugs: Without your magic we destroy you. 
* (OC) Snitches: Never reveal yourself to one of those, these monsters are not willing to negotiate. 
* (OC) Battlemages: When they wouldn't be so naive, they'd be an equal opponent.
* (NC) Healing mages: Reliable protectors.
* (NC) Ore thieves: Don't give me such an angry look or I'll tell it the healing mages.
* (FC) Rangers: They help us against monsters and thugs.
* (PSI) Gurus: Interested in a job as a temple guard?
* (PSI) Novices: Tough nuts. We won't ever convert them.
* (PSI) Templars: You should respect our way the same as we do yours.
* Evocator: You will never be true masters - wasters of the gift. 
* Secret Thieves Guild: Fodder. 

**What they say about locations:**
* OM: The Old Mine is protected quite well. The Mercs do not lower their guard.
* OC: The gate guards of the Old Camp aren't very good fighters.
* FM: To protect the Free Mine is quite a hard graft. From below the monsters and from above the danger from the Old Camp.
* FL: The scrapers from the Free Camp need our protection and we need their ore.
* EP: The Convoys coming from the Exchange Place are teeming with Mercenaries. Even an Ore baron is always around.
* MB: Kind of eerily this barrier. Animals can cross it, but men become insane thereby.
* NC: The protection of the New Camp has priority over everything else.
* SC: The people from the Sect Camp are very odd. But at least they don't get in our way.
* DT: No one gets me to this old tower at the cliff. I don't have a death wish.
* AM: Sometimes we go to the Abandoned Mine to practice our weapon skills.
* AF: The only place where things are still handled justly is the abandoned fort.


### Relevant Dialogues

Jarvis on the SLD (0.94k): "Our goal is to break out of here. We work hard for this. We do not want to lounge around, like the rags from the Old Camp, who just rest on the shoulders of the miners."

Jarvis on the SLD (1.06): "There are no guards or templars here, who protect you. Everyone looks after himself first and we, the Mercenaries, are the only ones who hold together." [...] "We - we are the Mercenaries of the Watermages. [...] And we all follow Lee. He is a great man. He is the only one who holds this damned camp together." 

Jarvis about their heap of ore, hating on the king (1.06): "When we would exchange it with the Outside World, the king would sell us his wife for this. / But we'll do a damn thing to give the ore to this old fuck. We want to get OUT of here!"

Lee on the responsibilities of a mercenary of the mages (1.06): "Very simple. Protect the ore - protect the mages. / Sometimes the mages have a special mission for one of us too."

Orik on the SLD (0.94k): "I am Orik, head of the mercenaries. My guys here are all former soldiers from the army, mercenaries and deserteurs. Good guys." [...] We protect the ore and the watermages. The mages may be able to look for themselves, but nobody touches the ore."

Kharim about the independence of the New Camp (1.06): "[...] You know nothing about us! The New Camp is INDEPENDENT of all this shit!"


### Conclusion

* Almost all of the mercenaries/guards of the New Camp were former soldiers in the royal army, mercenaries and deserteurs. Their leader (Lee) was a general during the *War of Varant* under Rhobar II. and later a bodyguard of the king [ADDQUOTE!]. Lee (and some others, such as Cord) were already thrown into the colony before the creation of the barrier, that much is known. 
* Thus based on them being originally described as gladiators, it is a logical consequence that when being thrown into the colony, these former soldiers were forced to fight for life in the arena to the amusement of the wardens; this is the root of their gladiator background and the reasoning behind their armours. 
* We know from the earliest Orpheus drafts that like the later orebarons they were also leaders of *the revolt*. 
* After the revolt they split from the Old Camp in disagreement with the ore barons about the question of cooperation with the king, while only the barons are now being celebrated as the "liberators" in the Old Camp (due to which the OC was originally even be called the "liberal camp").  
* The mercenaries see themselves as former slaves of the outside world ("We are your slaves no longer!") - or more concretely - as former slaves of the king. They have broken their chains not in order to make themselves dependent from the king once again in form of a deal like the barons do. They do not care for gold nor ore, just for freedom (and revenge). 
* Revenge is a major story thread for the guild; while not everyone was betrayed as worse as Lee, they were all betrayed insofar as that all of them once were servants of the king as soldiers and mercenaries in his war and were then imprisoned by the same. Thus, the guild is driven by a strong comradeship.
* They were supposed to be the strongest fighters in the colony besides the orebarons and have some sort of a codex, which has to be developed, obviously focused on such things as their responsibilities as protectors of the ore and the mages and their independence from the outside world with an absolute refusal of cooperation with the king. The latter is a source of conflict with the Free Camp, because the Free Camp or parts of them have a slightly different view and are sometimes secretly making deals with the Outside World, which the New Camp highly despises; an important factor that shows the independence of the Free Camp in the early vision). 

* We know that some of them are still gladiators - Orik fought in the arena before (see the Comic), Kharim fights in the arena in the game; a pupil from Cord was supposed to fight in the arena in Story v3.3 and the player would be send as another of his pupils to the arena in course of joining them (in this context, also see the famous late alpha screen, showing [the hero in the arena](https://images.gothicarchive.org/screenshots/orderedbylocation/oldcamp/tor9.jpg) (yes, this was the hero face at the time) with the light gladiator armour (sadly with the later version of the armour that was a downgrade from the original design seen further below, following the concept arts of Gorn)); later as a member of the Mercenaries he was to be send to fight in the arena against a baron. 
* Thus it is reasonable to assume that this lifestyle of being a gladiator, of regularly going back to the arena (reliving the past by stepping into the footsteps of their leaders), is an essential part of their tradition. Fighting in the arena (and we are speaking of fights to death here) is a kind of heroic act that they expect their men to go through. And this is why they (or the best of them) still call themselves "Gladiators" with pride. This way I have making sense of all the different ideas for the guild to create a full picture; and their armours only make sense, become believable, justified and meaningful through these explanations, that are all completely unknown to players of the release version.  


## Armour Design 

The armours will have to be a direct representation of the above summarised characteristics, combined with the specific conditions and limitations of their life in the colony. But let us start with the first relevant concepts. 

The following drawing by Mike can be seen as the very first idea for the armours of a member of this guild:

![Mikes first NC Warrior drawing](https://images.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/mikehoge/npcs/signal-2021-02-03-110059_Arenafighter.jpg)

It was, based on later sketches by Mike, roughly implemented into the game, in form of the general fighter armour in v0.56c including the leather helmet, [as it was often shown alongside this armour](https://images.gothicarchive.org/screenshots/orderedbylocation/newcamp/Gothic_1.jpg) in early Alpha screenshots. One may recognise how the helmet has been modeled in the shape of the helmet in the drawing above. 

Below are Ralfs first two known concepts of the guild (please remember, before imagening a mistake: "Garde" (Guard) was the name of the New Camp Warriors and "Söldner" (Mercenaries) was the name of the Old Camp Warriors at the time). It can be seen how the concept below has taken Mikes drawing into account and tried to develop it in another direction. 

![Ralfs first known concept for a member of the NC Guard guild](https://images.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/ralfmarczinczik/costumes/early/gardist1.jpg)

![Ralfs first known concept for a member of the NC Guard guild with the rank of an Officer](https://images.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/ralfmarczinczik/costumes/early/gardist-offizier.jpg)

The second concept also exists in a [colorised version here](https://images.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/ralfmarczinczik/costumes/early/gardist-offizier-coloured.jpg). The coat that he wears is made in the very same style as his early [watermage concept](https://images.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/ralfmarczinczik/costumes/later/NLMagierMitt.jpg), which shows that his original idea was to present both guilds in a very similar style. It was one faction with two strongly linked guilds, one being specialised in fighting, one being specialised in magic (healing mostly, as they are opposed to the battlemages of the Old Camp). Even if these concrete concepts can surely be critizised in several regards (Ralf himself is not too proud of these early ideas), I see some value in the general idea of a shared style of the two guilds, which, based on the individualisation of armours and robes, can still be fulfilled in case of a few NPCs in at least a similar style, mixed with the general design direction of the later concepts. 

The next and last known NC Guard armour designs by Ralf are the following:

![last known NC Guard armour designs by Ralf](https://images.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/ralfmarczinczik/costumes/later/ralf-nc-guards.jpg)

The light armour is now very much resembling what the armour would later become in the Alpha as presented below, only lacking the fur at the legs. It is the same armour that Gorn was shown wearing in the concepts by both Ralf and Tom Thiel. The medium armour is also already looking very much like the medium armour known from the game, but with no fur either. The heavy armour on the other hand has not too much resemblance to what it would finally turn into. It also may be noted that the three Guard armours are all shown with a blue hand as a distinctive mark (an idea that was completely rejected), while the organiser armours are all presented with a blue piece of fabric instead, which has been preserved and developed into the scarves of the alpha armours, with an exception of the heavy armour.

### Concept vs. Ingame Discrepancies

The final armour design came from Mike himself, in cooperation with Mike Hoge, evolving the latest concepts that Ralf came up with. Below we will present the three mercenary armours as they have been conceptualised by Mike and compare them to the actual ingame realisation of these armours in the game. They resemble the concepts very well, but there are some details in which they clearly divert from the concepts. We will argue that in every case, these diversions seem to be based on either misinterpretations of the concepts or simply be caused by suboptimal or lazy execution, since they add nothing to the armours and rather make them less believable than they could have been if following the concepts more loyally. We will thus take the armours of the Alpha as we have reconstructed them based on the renderings and Alpha screenshots and improve them based on the details of the concepts from which they divert.
