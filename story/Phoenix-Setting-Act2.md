### Island or Mainland

As a matter of fact and as described above, the idea of the colony being situated on an island was considered obsolete in 1998. But it still remained as an idea in the back of Mikes head and it is also reasonable in regard to *Escape from New York* as the original inspiration for the setting, which takes place on the island of Manhattan. 

The Comic (as well as, by the way, G2), show the City of Khorinis as being very close to the Colony and as directly connected. Thus, if an island, both the Colony and the City have to be located on it. 

Due to this lack of clarity during development, due to *Escape from New York*, due to the conflicting preferences both among the original developers and ourselves and due to specific historical inspirations that we do not want to mention here, we decided for the inbetween, a peninsula (german "Halbinsel", "Half-Island"). Khorinis and the Colony are located on an "Half-Island", such as e.g. Crimea. <!-- And it may or may not become a full island in the far future or may or may not have been a full island in the past. -->
