## Individual Relations

In most cases, the relation of an NPC to various other groups and themes equals the relation of the group he belongs to, which again equals the guild, faction, camp etc. in most cases. Thus we begin with the most general relations, such as between Outside World and Prison and how specific factions/camps relate to the Outside World. Varying relations of individual guilds within a faction or camp, or of individual NPCs within a guild, are exceptions and can therefore be summarised in one table each.

Example: All individual relations of the NPCs of a specific guild; how they differ from the groups they belong to. All individual relations of the guilds of a specific faction or camp; how or where they differ from the faction or camp they belong to.
