# Story

Everything about the story both of the original and the reborn "PHOENIX". 

We begin with the "setting", because the setting defines the basic conditions or background of the story. It is the situation that the player is confronted with at the start of the game and how it came about, it is about matters of time, of location and of historical, cultural and religious circumstances. 

The next section of the story is the game's "world". World design is inseparably connected with story design and <!-- in the development process of Gothic the story was mostly written based on the world, which came first. The exploration of the world is one of the most fundamental means of narration (in form of environmental story telling) and the characters (the "dramatis personae") of the story cannot be divided from the world they inhabit. The world is supposed to feel alive, the world is supposed to be a representation of the setting, the world is meant to tell parts of the background story and to some degree it is supposed to change in course of the story, visualising story twists, -->therefore we do not separate it from the story and deal with them as one. 

The next story section is the actual main plot which we deal with when the reader has acquired a good understanding of the setting and the world within which the plot - or the different plot(s), depending on the chosen faction - will unfold.
