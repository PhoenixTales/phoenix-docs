# Overworld



### Removed or unrealised Locations

* Rune Temple
* Island 
* Lighttower
* Half-Orcs in the forest
* Mage's Camp

Deal with every single one of those.

Fogtower/Lighttower:
Where would a lighthouse (in German "Leuchtturm", *lighttower*) be more fitting than here, hovering above the sea, close to the beach with the wreck? And what has the fogtower to do here, far away from the borders of the swamp and the fog of the area? 



### The Barrier, its Size and the Centre of the World

The size of the gameworld was never changed significantly. But in the world model of v0.5-0.6 the world reached further north and further south. In 0.7 onwards it was reduced in size towards the north and the south, but increased towards the east and west. In a result of this change of the world model and the necessary borders of the world, the Barrier was changed in its proportions to have more of a squished, oval shape instead of being a perfect sphere as it was originally meant to be. 

The Old Camp was always positioned right in the centre of the game world (point 0, at the crossing point of the global X and Y axes). This has never been changed. Only due to the reduction in size of the south and the north of the world in later versions, the Barrier's scale had to be reduced alongside and it was squished into an oval shape (originally it was supposed to be a perfect sphere). 

While the Old Camp itself has never been moved, this later change of the Barrier's extent put it slightly off the centre, if the barrier is seen as the border of the gameworld that it is. In any way, it was the Old Camp, originally called "Midcity", that was drawn first and that was always meant to be in the centre of the game world. 

It is a fact, that according to the original concept, the Sleeper was supposed to be under the Old Camp, he was conceived as sleeping at the very bottom of the Barrier or very close to it, at the "foot" of the barrier, deep below the Old Camp as the centre of the Barrier.

**PHOENIX:** If there is anything to change here, it would be to restore the additional space in the north and the south, to transform the barrier into a perfect sphere and make the Old Camp the centre of the Barrier again.
